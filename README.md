# Image Processing App
A simple C++ image processing app. I used the skeleton code provided by Prof. Sweedyk's 2015 Computer Graphcis course website: https://sites.google.com/site/cs155s15/ipproject

NOTE: The skeleton code was provided as an XCode project. At the time working on this project, I had access to a mac to use. Currently working on compiling on Windows!
